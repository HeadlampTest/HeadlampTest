### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Headlamp is the tool you use to visually track your Web UI testing and find gaps in your manual and automated tests.

This is the repository of all support-related goodies that you might find helpful.

First in: an automated test example using Microsoft Visual Studio, C#, MSTest, and the Selenium ChromeDriver. You'll want to look this over before you try to integrate Headlamp into your test automation.

We welcome contributions! Have you had success in using Headlamp in your test automation on non-Windows platforms, or with other Chrome browser test frameworks? Please share!
